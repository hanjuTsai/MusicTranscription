### Music sheets
To verify the accuracy of our transcription, we use MuseScore to auto generate sound based on our sheet music. As you can see, the piano sound is extremely similar to original one. Hence, our tool indeed help people save time transcribing the whole songs, instead they can get a rough one and spent only few time on revising.

## Project overview

Driven by the wish of offering NTU (National Taiwan University) A capella Club free sheet music that is so expensive  that students cannot afford. Because A capella music are usually song by a group, they need separate multiple source into each sheet musics. Because of the lack of end-to-end dataset, the project is divided into two phase, separate multiple music source, and transcribe each source into sheet music.
