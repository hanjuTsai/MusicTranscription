## Project overview
Driven by the wish of offering free sheet music to NTU (National Taiwan University) A capella Club, since music sheets is so expensive  that they cannot afford. Because A capella music are usually song by a group, they need separate multiple source into each sheet musics. Because of the lack of end-to-end dataset, the project is divided into two phase, separate multiple music source, and transcribe each source into sheet music.
